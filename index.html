<!-- This practice code introduces web workers, a mechanism that allows web applications to delegate tasks to separate threads. 
    Main threads and workers don't share variables directly but communicate through message passing in the form of message events. 
    While workers help maintain the responsiveness of the main application, it's important to note that they have limitations, such as restricted access to certain APIs, especially the DOM. -->
